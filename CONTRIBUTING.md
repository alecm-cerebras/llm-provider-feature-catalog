# Contributing

## Standards
- Each capability row should include:
  - status (✅ 🟡 ❌ 🔒 🧪 📝)
  - how_to_enable
  - response_path
  - caveats
  - validation evidence (doc link, test script, or ticket)

## Public vs Internal
- public/ must be customer-safe (no unpublished limits / tiering / eviction rules).
- internal/ can include sensitive operational nuance and positioning.

## TBD policy
If unsure, mark 📝 and add an owner + test plan.
